# 🧠 ADHD Detection API

## 🚀 Project Objective
Deploy a machine learning model as a REST API to assess ADHD risk based on behavioral metrics, providing instant predictions with probability scores.

## 🔍 Process
FastAPI backend with automated Swagger UI documentation
Predictive analytics: Returns risk level (low/medium/high) + confidence score
Deployed on Render for public access
Easy integration: JSON input/output for developers

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (FastAPI, Scikit-learn, Joblib)
- **Git/GitHub** for version control
- **Render** for cloud hosting
- **Swagger UI** for interactive testing

## 🌐 How to Use the API
### Via Swagger UI (Recommended for Testing)
1. Visit the live docs: 🔗<a href="https://adhd-datascience-project.onrender.com/docs">LINK</a>
2. Expand the **POST /predict** endpoint
3. Click **"Try it out"**
4. modify values
5. Click **"Execute"** to see the prediction!


## 🏁 Conclusion
This API provides a scalable way to screen for ADHD risk factors, enabling integration with healthcare apps or research tools. The live deployment demonstrates:
- ✅ ML model operationalization
- ✅ Clean API design
